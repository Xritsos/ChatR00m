# ChatR00m

## About the project
This is a chat website i made while studying electrical and computer engineering, to demonstrate basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP (and a little bit of SQL). The site was functional a while ago, but after graduation my connection to University's server ended. Hopefully, using another server it should work just fine.  

## How it works
The main page has a menu (in greek, which i will try to make it english, when there'll be time) and the user can access the chat only after creating an account (there's a link to the subscription page). In the menu there is also access to my personal data.  
To submit the user's data i use `MySQL` and `PHP` to save them to a database. After that the user can get to the chatroom (i use validation before that).  
The messages are seen by all people using the chat page and when finished there is a logout button. 

## Prerequisites
As i mentioned above the page is currently unavailable and in order to work it must be loaded to a server. Also, i used a database to store user's data, so you need to create one too. It was built with:  

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* MySQL
* PHP
